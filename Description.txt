Complete OptiMac Optimization Explanations
1. Memory & Performance Tab
Purge inactive memory
Command: sudo purge
What It Does: Forces macOS to immediately free up inactive memory that's cached but not actively being used
Benefits:

Instant RAM recovery - Can free up several GB of inactive memory

Better app responsiveness - More RAM available for active applications

Reduced memory pressure - Prevents system slowdowns on your 8GB M2 Mac
Best For: When you notice high memory usage but apps aren't actively using it

Clear system caches
Command: sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/* /System/Library/Caches/* /Library/Caches/*
What It Does: Removes cached files from user, system, and library cache directories
Benefits:

Frees disk space - Can recover several GB of storage

Resolves app issues - Corrupted cache files can cause crashes

Fresh app performance - Forces apps to rebuild optimized caches
Important: Apps may launch slightly slower initially as they rebuild caches

Optimize swap usage
Command: sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
What It Does: Reduces system tendency to use swap memory, keeping more data in RAM
Benefits:

Better RAM utilization - System prefers using physical RAM over swap

Reduced SSD wear - Less frequent writing to storage

Faster performance - RAM access is much faster than SSD swap
Critical for M2: Especially important with only 8GB RAM

Disable Spotlight indexing
Command: sudo mdutil -a -i off
What It Does: Turns off Spotlight's continuous file indexing across all drives
Benefits:

Reduced CPU usage - No more background indexing processes

Improved battery life - Less background activity

Faster file operations - No indexing interference during file copies
Trade-off: Spotlight search will not work; you'll lose instant file search

Smoother workflow - Direct access to applications

Disable Dashboard
Command: defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -bool true
What It Does: Completely turns off Dashboard feature
Benefits:

Memory savings - Dashboard widgets no longer consume RAM

Reduced background processes - Fewer system services running

Cleaner system - Removes rarely-used legacy feature

Optimize Mission Control
Command: defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0
What It Does: Removes animation delays in Mission Control transitions
Benefits:

Instant window switching - Mission Control appears immediately

Faster multitasking - No wait time between spaces/windows

More efficient workflow - Direct access to different desktop spaces

Enable TRIM (SSD optimization)
Command: sudo trimforce enable
What It Does: Enables TRIM support for third-party SSDs (Apple SSDs have it by default)
Benefits:

SSD longevity - Properly manages deleted data blocks

Maintained performance - Prevents SSD slowdown over time

Better storage efficiency - Optimizes available space management
Warning: Only enable if using third-party SSD; requires restart

3. Network Tab
Flush DNS cache
Command: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
What It Does: Clears stored DNS records and restarts DNS resolution service
Benefits:

Fixes website access issues - Resolves DNS-related connectivity problems

Updates DNS records - Gets fresh IP addresses for websites

Improves browsing speed - Removes potentially corrupted DNS entries
Perfect for: When websites won't load or load slowly

Optimize TCP settings
Command: sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=0
(Already explained above)

Disable IPv6 (if issues)
Command: networksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi
What It Does: Turns off IPv6 networking, using only IPv4
Benefits:

Resolves connection issues - Some networks have IPv6 problems

Faster DNS resolution - Avoids IPv6 lookup delays

Better compatibility - Works with older network equipment
Use Only If: Experiencing specific IPv6-related connectivity problems

Optimize Wi-Fi settings
Command: sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -z
(Already explained above)

4. Development Tab
Optimize Python/Conda
Command: conda clean --all -y
What It Does: Removes all cached packages, tarballs, and unused dependencies from Conda
Benefits:

Frees significant disk space - Conda cache can be multiple GB

Faster environment creation - Clean cache means fresh package downloads

Resolves package conflicts - Removes potentially corrupted cached packages
Perfect for: Your multi-version Python setup (3.12, 3.13)

Optimize Git performance
Command: git config --global core.preloadindex true; git config --global core.fscache true
What It Does: Enables Git performance optimizations for faster operations
Benefits:

Faster git status - Preloads index information

Improved file system performance - Caches file system calls

Quicker repository operations - Less disk I/O during Git commands
Essential for: Your FaceFusion and other development projects

Optimize Homebrew
Command: brew cleanup; brew doctor
What It Does: Removes old package versions and checks for common issues
Benefits:

Reclaims storage space - Removes outdated package files

Identifies problems - Doctor command finds configuration issues

Faster package operations - Clean Homebrew cache improves performance
Important for: Maintaining your development environment

Optimize Node.js
Command: npm cache clean --force
(Already explained above)

5. Advanced Tab
Thermal optimization
Command: sudo pmset -a thermalstate 0
What It Does: Disables thermal state monitoring that can throttle performance
Benefits:

Sustained performance - Prevents thermal throttling under load

Higher sustained speeds - CPU/GPU maintain higher frequencies longer

Better for intensive tasks - Ideal for video processing, ML workloads
Warning: Monitor temperatures manually; could lead to overheating

Power management tweaks
Command: sudo pmset -a standby 0; sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
What It Does: Disables deep sleep modes and automatic power-off features
Benefits:

Faster wake times - Mac wakes instantly from sleep

No hibernation delays - Eliminates deep sleep state transitions

Always-ready system - Better for development workflows
Trade-off: Slightly higher power consumption during sleep

Kernel parameter tweaks
Command: echo 'kern.maxfiles=65536' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
What It Does: Increases maximum number of files the system can have open simultaneously
Benefits:

Better for development - Handles more open files (databases, IDEs, servers)

Prevents file limit errors - Avoids "too many open files" errors
